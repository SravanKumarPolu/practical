# Promise practice

 In this case mainly focus on the promise  and async and await  how to reduce callback hell
 ### Promises
 A promise in js is an object  that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.it allwos you to write asynchronous code in a more manageable  and readable way than traditional callback-based approaches.

 ## Note : 
 Callback hell occurs when multiple asynchronous operations are nested within each other ,leading to deeply nested and hard-to-read code. Prommises help to avoid callback hell.
